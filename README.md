# Cataloginator!
A simple python script with a comprehensive GUI that downloads lots of images from an Excel table, then adds a date to the image (given in the third excel column), then provides extensive cataloging functionality.
Made for quite specific use, won't work with random stuff.
Usage: run the main python file, installing all the pre-requisite libraries beforehand: PIL (Pillow), pandas, openyxl, aiohttp, bs4, validators, tkinter (might already be included).
For windows: run newest Cataloginator.exe from the releases.
